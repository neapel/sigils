Sigils of Summoning-Poster
==========================

I found [this image](http://i.imgur.com/95Kvb.png) on the web, if you know anything about its creators, please tell me!

Please note that I know absolutely nothing about the subject, I just linked the geometric look of it, which is why the individual symbols are implemented in [TikZ](http://pgf.sourceforge.net/) for maximum precision (as far as I could tell…)

Since I wasn't able to identify the exact font used in the original poster, this one uses Interstate Thin by The Font Bureau which costs 30€. If you know a better font, please let me know.

See [summons.pdf](https://github.com/funkycoder/sigils/raw/master/summons.pdf) for the result.

There is one version using [Yanone Kaffeesatz Thin](http://www.yanone.de/typedesign/kaffeesatz/) (because it's the only free of charge hairline font I know), and one using exljbris free [Delicious](http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/delicious.html), [Fontin](http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/fontin.html) and [Fontin Sans](http://www.josbuivenga.demon.nl/fontinsans.html) fonts (which is currently the default, change [`fontCase`](https://github.com/funkycoder/sigils/blob/master/summons.tex#L9) appropriately)
